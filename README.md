# SpaceX Launch Insights 🚀

Data analysis and machine learing project predicting SpaceX first stage reuse and estimating launch costs using SpaceX launch data.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). The objective of this project is to apply end-to-end data science skills, from data collection and wrangling to analysis , visualization, and building machine learning models.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and clean data from sources.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
- Apply clustering and/or predictive modeling techniques.
- Communicate results through visualizations and a final report.
